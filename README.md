# Hii World!

I am a software developer specialized in Full-Stack Web development. 

- 🪟 I don't have any Windows OS machine. If I really need to work with C# or VS, it's in my VirtualBox.
- 🐧 Linux enthusiast and preferred to game on Linux. I'd uninstall the game if it doesn't run with Proton.
- 🕹 SteamDeck owner but I'll occasionally use it as a desktop.
- 🤖 I like AOSP Android but I try to avoid Google. Don't ask me why...
